# Compressive-Sensing-Based-Inference
This work deals with the high level inference (face recognition) using compressive sensing (CS). Images are compressed using compressive sensing scheme and the generated compressed samples are used as features for linear support vector machine. The purpose of this work is to verify the possibility of performing high-level inference on-chip using CS. Image snesor acquires the image in compressed domain perfoming acquisition and compression at the same time. These compressed samples are obtained by projecting the pixels values in some low-dm=imensional space using measurement matrix. This compressed image samples should require less number of bits as compared to the conventional image sensor. Smaller the number of bits needed for compressed image better is the compression. These compressed image samples possess the information of signal and hence can be directly used as feature input to linear SVM.
## How it function?
This work has two main files Face_detection_using_CS.m and sigma_delta_UD_Cunter_col.m and the third is readme.md. The first file is the main file and holds the code for main program. The second file is a function to perform Sigma-Delta ADC which is called by the first file. Keep the two files in the same folders. Downloaded dataset (links given below) must be kept in rootFolder with name of subfolders as mentioned in the main program (Face_detection_using_CS.m).
