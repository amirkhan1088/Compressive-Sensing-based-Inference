# Compressive-Sensing-Based-Inference
This work deals with the high level inference (face recognition) using compressive sensing (CS). Images are compressed using compressive sensing scheme and the generated compressed samples are used as features for linear support vector machine. The purpose of this work is to verify the possibility of performing high-level inference on-chip using CS. Image snesor acquires the image in compressed domain perfoming acquisition and compression at the same time. This compressed image samples should require less number of bits as compared to the conventional image sensor. Smaller the number of bits needed for compressed image better is the compression. These compressed image samples possess the information of signal and hence can be directly used as feature input to linear SVM.
